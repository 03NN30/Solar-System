to do (difficulties):

- left click on planets will show information about their distance from the sun, speed, min-max temperature
- add ring to corresponding planets
- add asteroid circle 
**
- no stars inside solarsystem
- increase render distance
- real distances
*
- add other moons
- move transformation functions inside of update
- move gui inside of update

bugs:
- minimizing GUI while in follower mode, will stop follower mode and GUI can't be reactivated 
- bloom doesn't work while mirroring
